# 📄 Project Overview

## 🧩 Problem

Gym owners often struggle to track member attendance and identify which customers are at risk of leaving. Without the ability to analyze customer behavior, it's difficult to take proactive steps to retain members. Most gyms lack a personalized and data-driven system to monitor engagement or integrate targeted retention campaigns.

## 💡 Solution

Our system provides a microservice-based platform for gym analytics and retention support. It allows each gym to create its own account, monitor attendance, and segment customers using real-time behavioral data. Specifically, it enables:

- Automatic detection of at-risk customers based on attendance frequency and recency
- A web dashboard that visualizes key customer metrics per gym
- Email functionality to contact at-risk customers directly from the platform
- Integration with gym marketing efforts to re-engage members before they churn

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

- Better visibility into customer behavior across gyms
- Reduced churn through timely, data-driven retention actions
- Personalized outreach via built-in email communication
- Improved customer lifetime value and engagement
